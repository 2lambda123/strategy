# Incubation

[Incubation](https://www.w3.org/Guide/incubation.html) can happen in CGs, BGs, IGs, WGs, and outside of W3C.  

We should track work in this phase, identify how much team support and
guidance to give it, and watch for products that can be useful in
rec-track work, including reports, prototypes, and draft specs.

Not all useful-to-the-Web work is specs or happens at W3C, so if
incubation produces work of different forms that we can help the Web
by facilitating elsewhere, let's figure out how to encourage that too.
